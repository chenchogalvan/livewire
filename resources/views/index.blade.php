                Building modern web apps is hard. Tools like Vue and React are extremely powerful, but the complexity they add to a full-stack developer's workflow is insane.

            <p class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 fs-2">
                That's where Livewire comes in.

                Livewire is a full-stack framework for building modern, dynamic, interactive web applications using Laravel. It allows developers to create responsive and real-time user interfaces without the need for writing extensive javascript code.
            </p>
            <p class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 fs-5">
                Livewire also integrates seamlessly with Laravel's Blade templating engine, allowing developers to easily create dynamic views.
            </p>
            <div class="col-md-8 offset-md-2 fs-5">
                It's something weird to explain with words, but the best way to understand how livewire works are to just looking at the code.
